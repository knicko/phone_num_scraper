**Primary Findings**
+ Phone numbers are bolded out. ID's are connected to names. Use ID's for searching for people. Discord webhooks to output information.

**Recommendations**
+ Find faster way to run scraper tool.

**Conlusions**
+ Ran into lots of issues, but mainly best way to scrape is to identify id associated with person, assuming person's name is correctly stated on CSV. 

**Next Steps**
+ Utilize peoplelooker for more information! Off-load from .ipynb/Jupyter. Export data directly to SQL DB.
